when used with an autofs direct mount. A local user could exploit this flaw to
cause a denial of service (system crash) via an open system call. (CVE-2014-0203)

Toralf F&#246 rster reported an error in the Linux kernels syscall auditing on
32 bit x86 platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (OOPS and system crash). (CVE-2014-4508)

An information leak was discovered in the control implementation of the
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A
local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from
kernel memory. (CVE-2014-4652)

A use-after-free flaw was discovered in the Advanced Linux Sound
Architecture (ALSA) control implementation of the Linux kernel. A local
user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2014-4653)

A authorization bug was discovered with the snd_ctl_elem_add function of
the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) in the Linux kernel. A local
user could exploit his bug to cause a denial of service (remove kernel
controls). (CVE-2014-4654)

A flaw discovered in how the snd_ctl_elem function of the Advanced Linux
Sound Architecture (ALSA) handled a reference count. A local user could
exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and limit
bypass). (CVE-2014-4655)

An integer overflow flaw was discovered in the control implementation of
the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). A local user could exploit
this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2014-4656)

An integer underflow flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of
the backlog value for certain SCTP packets. A remote attacker could exploit
this flaw to cause a denial of service (socket outage) via a crafted SCTP
packet. (CVE-2014-4667)

Jason Gunthorpe reported a flaw with SCTP authentication in the Linux
kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS). (CVE-2014-5077)" );
