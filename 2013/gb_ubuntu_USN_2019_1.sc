	script_tag( name: "insight", value: "An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6
Router Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack. A
remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain
sensitive information. (CVE-2013-0343)

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of
the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw
to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory
corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report
ID. (CVE-2013-2888)

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem
when CONFIG_HID_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could
leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted
device. (CVE-2013-2889)

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem
of the Linux kernel when CONFIG_HID_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically
proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds
write) via a specially crafted device. (CVE-2013-2892)

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)
subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG_LOGITECH_FF,
CONFIG_LOGIG940_FF, or CONFIG_LOGIWHEELS_FF are enabled. A physcially
proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias
a specially crafted device. (CVE-2013-2893)

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)
subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG_HID_LOGITECH_DJ is enabled. A
physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or
obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted
device. (CVE-2013-2895)

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's Human Interface
Device (HID) subsystem's support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically
proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. (CVE-2013-2896)

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID)
subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG_HID_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A
physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of
service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. (CVE-2013-2897)

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem
of the Linux kernel when CONFIG_HID_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically
proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
(OOPS) via a specially crafted device. (CVE-2013-2899)
