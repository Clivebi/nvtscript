  An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
  found in the GIMP's Microsoft Windows Bitmap (BMP) and Personal Computer
  eXchange (PCX) image file plug-ins. An attacker could create a
  specially-crafted BMP or PCX image file that, when opened, could cause the
  relevant plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2009-1570, CVE-2011-1178)

  A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's Paint Shop Pro
  (PSP) image file plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted PSP
  image file that, when opened, could cause the PSP plug-in to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the GIMP. (CVE-2010-4543)

  A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's Lightning,
  Sphere Designer, and Gfig image filters. An attacker could create a
  specially-crafted Lightning, Sphere Designer, or Gfig filter configuration
  file that, when opened, could cause the relevant plug-in to crash or,
  potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
  the GIMP. (CVE-2010-4540, CVE-2010-4541, CVE-2010-4542)

  Red Hat would like to thank Stefan Cornelius of Secunia Research for
  responsibly reporting the CVE-2009-1570 flaw.

  Users of the GIMP are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
  contain backported patches to correct these issues. The GIMP must be
