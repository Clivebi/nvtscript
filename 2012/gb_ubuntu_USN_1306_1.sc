  David Baron, Gary Kwong, Jim Blandy, Bob Clary, Jesse Ruderman, Marcia
  Knous, and Rober Longson discovered several memory safety issues which
  could possibly be exploited to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code as
  the user that invoked Firefox. (CVE-2011-3660)

  Aki Helin discovered a crash in the YARR regular expression library that
  could be triggered by javascript in web content. (CVE-2011-3661)

  It was discovered that a flaw in the Mozilla SVG implementation could
  result in an out-of-bounds memory access if SVG elements were removed
  during a DOMAttrModified event handler. An attacker could potentially
  exploit this vulnerability to crash Firefox. (CVE-2011-3658)

  Mario Heiderich discovered it was possible to use SVG animation accessKey
  events to detect key strokes even when JavaScript was disabled. A malicious
  web page could potentially exploit this to trick a user into interacting
  with a prompt thinking it came from the browser in a context where the user
  believed scripting was disabled. (CVE-2011-3663)

  It was discovered that it was possible to crash Firefox when scaling an OGG
  <video> element to extreme sizes. (CVE-2011-3665)" );
