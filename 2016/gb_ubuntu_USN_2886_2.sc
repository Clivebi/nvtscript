  vulnerability existed in the AF_UNIX implementation in the Linux kernel.
  A local attacker could use crafted epoll_ctl calls to cause a denial of service
  (system crash) or expose sensitive information. (CVE-2013-7446)

  It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not
  properly restore the values of the Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT). A
  user-assisted attacker in a KVM guest could cause a denial of service in
  the host (system crash). (CVE-2015-7513)

  It was discovered that the ppp implementation in the Linux kernel did
  not ensure that certain slot numbers are valid. A local attacker with the
  privilege to call ioctl() on /dev/ppp could cause a denial of service
  (system crash). (CVE-2015-7799)

  Sasha Levin discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS)
  implementation in the Linux kernel had a race condition when checking
  whether a socket was bound or not. A local attacker could use this to cause
  a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2015-7990)

  It was discovered that the Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel
  incorrectly handled compressed inline extants on truncation. A local
  attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8374)

  It was discovered that the Linux kernel networking implementation did
  not validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, A local
  attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
  possibly gain administrative privileges. (CVE-2015-8543)

  Felix Wilhelm discovered a race condition in the Xen paravirtualized
  drivers which can cause double fetch vulnerabilities. An attacker in the
  paravirtualized guest could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
  (crash the host) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host.
  (CVE-2015-8550)

  Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the pptp implementation in the Linux kernel
  did not verify an address length when setting up a socket. A local attacker
  could use this to craft an application that exposed sensitive information
  from kernel memory. (CVE-2015-8569)

  David Miller discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux
  kernel did not properly validate the socket address length for Synchronous
  Connection-Oriented (SCO) sockets. A local attacker could use this to
  expose sensitive information. (CVE-2015-8575)

  It was discovered that the Linux kernel's Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)
  implementation did not handle initial zero length segments properly. A
  local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (unkillable
  task). (CVE-2015-8785)" );
